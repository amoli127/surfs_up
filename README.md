## Project overview

This analysis aims to study how feasible it is to establish a surf and ice cream business in Oahu, Hawaii. During the analysis, the weather in Ouahu was checked to predict how this would affect the business's success and to convince investor W. Avy that the idea of the surf and ice cream shop was a good investment. W. Avy requested the temperatures for June and December to find out if the business is sustainable year-round.

## Results

The result of the temperature analysis for June and December were the following:

  - In June, the average temperature was 74 degrees Fahrenheit; in December, the average was 71 degrees.

  - During June, the highest temperature recorded was 85 degrees, and the lowest was 64 degrees Fahrenheit.

  - During December, the highest temperature recorded was 83 degrees, and the lowest was 56 degrees.

## Summary

The difference in average temperatures between June and December is 3 degrees, being higher in June, which indicates that the climate in Oahu is maintained and if it would be feasible for the business of a surf and ice cream shop. In terms of weather, Oahu presents a perfect setting for the business, but there are additional analyzes that could provide a better prediction for the company. One of them would be to evaluate how many ice cream shops there are in the area and what services are offered; this would help to identify what kind of competition there is in the industry. Another essential aspect that can be analyzed is the wave conditions; this is one of the critical factors for surfers, and knowing if the wave conditions are favorable can prove a decisive point for the business.
