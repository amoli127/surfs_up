## Project overview

This analysis aims to study how feasible it is to establish a surf and ice cream business in Oahu, Hawaii. During the analysis, the weather in Ouahu was checked to predict how this would affect the business's success and to convince investor W. Avy that the idea of the surf and ice cream shop was a good investment. W. Avy requested the temperatures for June and December to find out if the business is sustainable year-round.

## Results

The result of the temperature analysis for June and December were the following:



  - In June, the average temperature was 74 degrees Fahrenheit; in December, the average was 71 degrees.

  - During June, the highest temperature recorded was 85 degrees, and the lowest was 64 degrees Fahrenheit.

  - During December, the highest temperature recorded was 83 degrees, and the lowest was 56 degrees.
